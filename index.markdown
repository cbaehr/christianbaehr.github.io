I am a Ph.D Candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. I am also a graduate affiliate with the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance and a Graduate Fellow with the Princeton Sovereign Finance Lab. You can find an updated version of my CV [<span style="color:#1a73e8">here</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/i0g8oah9l7sury15gsg90/baehr_cv.pdf?rlkey=s3zq5x9twmkaomxws45d1jhqf&st=nudnm6eb&dl=0).

My dissertation project analyzes the effects of international economic changes related to climate change and trade on domestic institutional development and the political behavior of domestic actors. More broadly, I study the political economy of climate change and government finance. My interests also include the politics of sovereign debt, the political economy of natural resources, and the impact of development interventions on human development and the environment.

I have extensive teaching experience spanning international relations and quantitative methods. At Princeton, I have assisted in instruction for PhD-level coursework in quantitative analysis and text-as-data and multiple undergraduate courses in international relations. I co-organized the R for Public Policy course for the Princeton Junior Summer Institute from 2022-24. I previously designed and taught courses in introductory and advanced statistical programming and political methodology at William & Mary.

Previously, I was an analyst for the AidData Research Lab at William & Mary, where I conducted geospatial impact evaluations of development projects and also managed the AidData Geocoding team. I earned a A.B. in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis and an M.A. in Politics from Princeton University.

    My dissertation project investigates how diverse political actors respond to economic disruptions rooted in climate change and trade. In one chapter, currently under review, I investigate how governments respond to permanent, negative shocks to oil revenues. Building on the resource curse literature, I theorize that enduring oil price declines impose fiscal constraints on distributive policies of governments, forcing them to strategically invest in improving state effectiveness. The project links the resource curse literature to the clean energy transition and leverages the 2010 shale oil revolution as a natural experiment to show that rather than retrenching or liberalizing in the face of long-term oil price declines, governments instead pursue limited institutional reforms. <br>
    <br>
    A second chapter, co-authored with Fiona Bare and Vincent Heddesheimer, examines how firms respond to business risks and opportunities from climate change. This paper has been conditionally accepted for publication at the American Journal of Political Science. We develop a theory of firm lobbying behavior grounded in the distinct policy solutions relevant to various types of climate exposure. Using firm-level data from earnings calls and lobbying disclosures, we show that firms are more likely to engage in lobbying when they perceive climate-related business opportunities, not just risks. <br>
    <br>
    The final chapter investigates voting responses to labor market disruptions from trade and climate change. While past work links employment in directly exposed industries (e.g., import-competing or fossil fuel sectors) to voting behavior, I argue that broader community-level effects are rooted in material harms experienced through indirect labor market exposure. This study challenges the view that such effects are purely identity-based, showing that indirect exposure still results in meaningful economic disruption—and political consequences—for workers in adjacent industries. This research has implications for the design of compensation and transition policies.

      As climate impacts intensify, governments increasingly deploy climate adaptation policies, yet their electoral consequences remain poorly understood. We study moratoria on homeowners insurance nonrenewals after California wildfires. Using a difference-in-differences design exploiting eligibility rules, we find null effects on electoral support for the incumbents. To explain this, we argue that the electoral effect of adaptation is path-dependent: prior crisis experience sets the standard for what voters perceive as a sufficient policy. Consistent with this, we find a modest electoral reward where prior insurance disruption was limited, but none where it was chronic. Survey evidence indicates that, prior to the policy, residents of high-disruption areas already held more negative and crystallized views of the governor. Our findings offer a framework for the politics of adaptation, showing that credit hinges on perceived sufficiency: a standard set not by the policy alone, but by voters' prior experience with the crisis.
